This repository currently features three different issue templates and one pull request template. When creating a new issue the template chooser is presented
and a template has to be chosen for the new issue. Nevertheless is still possible to start from a blank issue.  
For pull requests only one template is available for all PRs.

The templates are rather extensive and shall help its user to not forget certain aspects of an issue or a PR. Sections that are not applicable can be freely deleted.

**Regarding the role of the task template:** This template should only be used for issue, for which none of the other two is applicable. Examples for such cases might be

* Task to create a dump of a database
* Action plan for a maintenance window
* Creating a report for somebody
